## getting the number of unique aisles
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  summarise(count = n_distinct(aisle))
```

## getting the aisles with the most item ordered
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(total_items = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_items))
```

## making plot for aisle and number of items ordered 

```{r}

  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(total_items = n()) %>% 
  filter(total_items > 10000) %>%

## making a table for the three most popular items 

```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%

## create table for pink landy apples and coffee ice cream 
```{r}

## problem 2 
loading dataset 
```{r}
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

## cleaning dataset 

```{r}
brfss_df <- brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(county = locationdesc, state = locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health",

    levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), exclude = NULL),
    county = gsub("-", "", as.character(county)),
    county = substring(county, first = 4))

```
## 2002 data

```{r}
brfss_2002 <- brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(locations = n()) %>% 
  filter(locations >= 7) 
```
In 2002,`r with(brfss_2002, paste(unique(state), collapse = ", "))` were observed to have 7 or more locations. 

## 2010 data
```{r}
brfss_2010 <- brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(locations = n()) %>% 
  filter(locations >= 7) 
```
In 2010,`r with(brfss_2010, paste(unique(state), collapse = ", "))` were observed to have 7 or more locations. 

```{r}
